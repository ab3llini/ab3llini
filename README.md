## Alberto Bellini

**Machine Learning Engineer @ DocuSign Applied Science**

Currently wrangling terabytes of documents and building NLP systems that actually work in production. Previously made real estate pricing models less wrong and co-founded an AI startup.

### What I'm Into
Obsessed with **large-scale NLP** and the beautiful chaos of **distributed systems**. Love the challenge of taking transformer models from "works on my laptop" to "processes millions of documents without falling over."  

Deep in the **Spark + Databricks** ecosystem, building ETL pipelines that don't make you want to throw your laptop out the window. Comfortable juggling **PyTorch transformers**, **distributed training**, and the occasional **Rust** side project when Python feels too slow.

Have a soft spot for **information extraction**, **document understanding**, and making LLMs do useful things beyond writing poetry. Also enjoy the dark arts of **MLOps** - because someone has to make sure your beautiful model actually runs in production.

### Recent Experiments
- **NLP at Scale**: Transformer pipelines for document processing, because regex isn't always the answer
- **Research**: Combined GPT-2 with vision encoders for visual question answering back when that was still novel ([code](https://github.com/ab3llini/Transformer-VQA))
- **Side Quest**: Built a differentiable tensor engine in Rust because why not ([carbon](https://github.com/ab3llini/carbon))

**Stack**: Python â€¢ PyTorch â€¢ Transformers â€¢ Spark â€¢ Databricks â€¢ Kubernetes â€¢ Rust â€¢ SQL (yes, it counts)

Currently exploring how far we can push transformer architectures before they become sentient ðŸ¤–
